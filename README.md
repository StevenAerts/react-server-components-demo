# React Server Components on Netlify

This is a very minimal example of using React Server Components via Netlify Functions

To run locally, clone this repository and run:

```
npm i
netlify dev
```

And you should have a local env with both the client side application and the server side components rendered via a Netlify functions.

This is aiming to be a much simpler starting point than the much more involved [full demo](https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo) from the core React team
